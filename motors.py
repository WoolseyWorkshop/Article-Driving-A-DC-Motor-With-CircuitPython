    - The BIN2 pin is connected to pin D12.
    - The AOUT1 pin is connected to motor A's positive pin.
    - The AOUT2 pin is connected to motor A's negative pin.
    - The BOUT1 pin is connected to motor B's positive pin.
    - The BOUT2 pin is connected to motor B's negative pin.
    - The VMOTOR+ pin is connected to a 6-9 volt power supply.

    - https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/shared-bindings/analogio/
    - Provides analog hardware support.
- countio CircuitPython Core Module
    - https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/shared-bindings/countio/

- digitalio CircuitPython Core Module
    - https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shared-bindings/digitalio/
    - Provides basic digital pin support.
- pwmio CircuitPython Core Module

Notes
-----

- Some boards share PWM channels across pins, e.g. pins D9 and D25 on the
  Adafruit Feather RP2040.  Make sure to select different PWM channels for all
  of the motor pins since every pin could be using PWM at the same time.
- Comments are Sphinx (reStructuredText) compatible.

TODO
----

- None.
